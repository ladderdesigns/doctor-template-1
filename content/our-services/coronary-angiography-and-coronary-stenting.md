  material) and x-rays to see how blood flows through the arteries in your
  heart.

  Coronary angiography is a diagnostic procedure that is used to visualize the
  inside of the coronary arteries, which are the blood vessels that supply
  oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. During the procedure, a thin, flexible
  tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or leg and
  carefully threaded through the bloodstream to the coronary arteries. A special
  dye (contrast material) is injected through the catheter, and x-ray images are
  taken as the dye passes through the coronary arteries. These images allow the
  healthcare provider to see the size and shape of the arteries, as well as any
  areas of narrowing or blockage.


  Coronary angiography is often used to diagnose coronary artery disease, which is a condition in which the coronary arteries become narrowed or blocked by a buildup of plaque. Plaque is a substance made up of fat, cholesterol, and other substances that can accumulate on the inner walls of the arteries, restricting blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attack or other serious cardiovascular problems.


  If a significant blockage is found during coronary angiography, Dr. Chandramouli may recommend a procedure called coronary stenting to open the blocked artery and restore normal blood flow. During coronary stenting, a small, mesh-like device called a stent is inserted through the catheter and placed inside the blocked artery. The stent is then expanded, pushing the plaque outward and creating a larger opening for blood to flow through. Coronary stenting is a minimally invasive procedure that is usually performed with the aid of x-ray guidance. It is often used in combination with other treatments, such as medications or lifestyle changes, to help manage and prevent further progression of coronary artery disease.
