  Coronary rotational atherectomy is a procedure that is similar to angioplasty,
  where a catheter with a balloon at its end is inserted and inflated to open a
  blocked artery. Sometimes, however, the blockage in the artery has calcified,
  or hardened. In this case, the angioplasty is unable to work against the
  plaque. During rotational atherectomy the plaque is ground into minuscule
  particles, which is then cleaned from the bloodstream.

  Rotational atherectomy and laser atherectomy are medical procedures that are
  used to remove plaque (a buildup of fat, cholesterol, and other substances)
  from the inside of blood vessels, such as the coronary arteries that supply
  blood to the heart. These procedures are often used to treat coronary artery
  disease, a condition in which the coronary arteries become narrowed or blocked
  by plaque, restricting blood flow and increasing the risk of heart attack or
  other serious cardiovascular problems.


  During a rotational atherectomy, a special catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is inserted into the blood vessel and advanced to the area of plaque buildup. The catheter has a small, rotating burr on the end that is used to shave or grind away the plaque. The debris that is generated by the rotational atherectomy is then suctioned out through the catheter.


  During a laser atherectomy, a laser fiber is inserted through a catheter and used to vaporize or disintegrate the plaque. The laser energy is delivered through a small, flexible fiber that is inserted through the catheter and advanced to the area of plaque buildup. The laser energy is then used to break down the plaque, and the debris is suctioned out through the catheter.


  Both rotational atherectomy and laser atherectomy are minimally invasive procedures that are usually performed with the aid of x-ray guidance. They are often used in combination with other treatments, such as medications or lifestyle changes, to help manage and prevent further progression of coronary artery disease.
