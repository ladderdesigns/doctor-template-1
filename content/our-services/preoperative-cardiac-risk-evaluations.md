  Preoperative cardiac risk evaluations are important for people who are
  planning to undergo surgery, as they help to identify any potential risks or
  complications that may arise due to the patient's cardiac (heart) health.
  During a preoperative cardiac risk evaluation, Dr. Chandramouli will assess
  the patient's current heart health and medical history to determine the
  likelihood of any cardiac problems occurring during or after surgery.


  The evaluation may include a physical examination, as well as various tests and procedures such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, or stress test. Dr. Chandramouli may also ask the patient about their current medications and any history of heart problems or previous surgeries.


  Based on the results of the evaluation, Dr. Chandramouli may recommend certain measures to reduce the risk of cardiac complications during surgery. These might include adjusting the patient's medication regimen, ordering additional tests or procedures, or referring the patient to a specialist for further evaluation and management.


  Overall, preoperative cardiac risk evaluations are an important part of ensuring the safety and success of surgical procedures, and can help to reduce the risk of complications and improve patient outcomes.
