  Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a diagnostic test. This test uses sound
  waves to see inside blood vessels. It is useful for evaluating the coronary
  arteries that supply the heart.

  Intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS) is a medical procedure that uses sound
  waves to produce detailed images of the inside of blood vessels. It is often
  used to visualize the inside of the coronary arteries, which are the blood
  vessels that supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle.


  During an IVUS procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or leg and carefully threaded through the bloodstream to the area of interest. The catheter is equipped with a small ultrasound probe at its tip, which is used to produce and transmit sound waves that bounce off the walls of the blood vessel. The reflected sound waves are then detected by the probe and used to create a detailed, cross-sectional image of the vessel.


  IVUS can be used to assess the size and shape of the blood vessel, as well as any areas of narrowing or blockage. It can also be used to guide the placement of other medical devices, such as stents, which are used to open up blocked or narrowed blood vessels. IVUS is a non-invasive procedure that is generally well-tolerated by patients, and it can provide valuable information to help diagnose and manage various cardiovascular conditions.
