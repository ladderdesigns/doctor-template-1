shortdesc: Warfarin (Coumadin) is a medicine that makes your blood less likely
  to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been
  told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating
  certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this
  happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.

  The Coumadin anticoagulation clinic is our specialized healthcare facility
  that provides care and support for individuals who are taking Coumadin (also
  known as warfarin), a medication that is used to prevent blood clots from
  forming. Coumadin is often prescribed for people who are at high risk of
  developing blood clots, such as those with atrial fibrillation (a type of
  abnormal heart rhythm) or a history of deep vein thrombosis (blood clots in
  the legs).


  Coumadin works by blocking the action of vitamin K, which is necessary for the production of certain blood clotting factors. By reducing the production of these clotting factors, Coumadin helps to prevent the formation of blood clots, which can reduce the risk of serious complications such as stroke or pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs).


  However, Coumadin can also increase the risk of bleeding, especially if the dosage is not carefully monitored. This is because Coumadin can interfere with the normal blood clotting process, making it more difficult for the body to stop bleeding when an injury occurs.


  The Coumadin anticoagulation clinic is designed to help patients manage their Coumadin therapy and reduce the risk of bleeding or other complications. The clinic may offer a variety of services, such as:


  • Monitoring: The clinic may provide regular blood tests (known as INR tests) to measure the patient's blood clotting time, and adjust the dosage of Coumadin accordingly.


  • Education: The clinic may provide information and guidance on how to manage Coumadin therapy, including tips on diet, medication interactions, and other important considerations.


  • Support: The clinic may offer support and assistance with issues such as scheduling appointments, filling prescriptions, and coordinating care with other healthcare providers.


  Overall, a Coumadin anticoagulation clinic can provide an important resource for individuals who are taking Coumadin, helping to ensure that their therapy is effective and safe.
