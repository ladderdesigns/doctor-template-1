  Myocardial perfusion is an imaging test. It's also called a nuclear stress
  test. It is performed to record how well blood flows through the heart. It
  also shows how well the heart muscle is pumping. For example, after a heart
  attack, it may be done to find areas of damaged heart muscle. This test may be
  done during rest and during exercise.

  Stress testing is a procedure that is used to evaluate how well the heart
  functions during physical activity. It is often used to diagnose and manage
  heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease or heart failure, and can
  help Dr. Chandramouli identify any problems with the heart's ability to pump
  blood effectively.


  During a stress test, the patient performs a specific type of physical activity, usually walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike, while their heart function is monitored. The test is usually stopped when the patient reaches a certain level of exhaustion or when certain changes in the heart's function are detected. Dr. Chandramouli may also ask the patient to take certain medications before the test to simulate the effects of physical activity on the heart.


  Myocardial perfusion nuclear scanning is a type of stress test that uses a small amount of radioactive material (called a tracer) and a special camera to create detailed images of the heart as it pumps blood. The tracer is injected into a vein in the patient's arm, and the camera is used to take pictures of the heart as the tracer travels through the blood vessels. The pictures can show Dr. Chandramouli how well blood is flowing to the different parts of the heart, and can help to identify any areas of decreased blood flow that may be caused by blockages or other problems.


  Overall, stress testing and myocardial perfusion nuclear scanning are useful tools for evaluating the heart's function and identifying potential problems that may need to be addressed.
