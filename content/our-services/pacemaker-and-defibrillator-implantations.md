  A pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device. This device senses when your
  heart is beating irregularly or too slowly. It sends a signal to your heart
  that makes your heart beat at the correct pace. An implantable cardiac
  defibrillator is a device that monitors your heart rate and delivers a strong
  electrical shock to restore the heartbeat to normal in the event of
  tachycardia.

  Pacemaker and defibrillator implantations are medical procedures that are used
  to treat heart rhythm problems.


  A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted under the skin in the patient's chest. It consists of a battery and a group of wires (called leads) that are placed inside the heart. The pacemaker sends small electrical signals to the heart to help regulate its rhythm and ensure that it is beating at the appropriate rate. Pacemakers are often used to treat slow heart rhythms (called bradycardias) or to coordinate the contractions of the heart's chambers in people with heart block or other types of abnormal heart rhythms.


  A defibrillator is a device that is similar to a pacemaker, but it is used to treat fast heart rhythms (called tachycardias) or sudden cardiac arrest (a life-threatening condition in which the heart suddenly stops beating). Defibrillators are equipped with a built-in shock delivery system that can automatically detect and treat life-threatening heart rhythms by delivering a strong electrical shock to the heart. Like pacemakers, defibrillators are implanted under the skin in the patient's chest, and are connected to leads that are placed inside the heart.


  Both pacemaker and defibrillator implantations are typically performed by a cardiologist or other specialist in a hospital setting, and involve a surgical procedure to insert the device and attach the leads. The procedures are usually done under general anesthesia, and patients may need to stay in the hospital for a short period of time after the surgery to recover. Pacemakers and defibrillators can significantly improve the quality of life for people with heart rhythm problems, and can help to prevent serious complications such as heart attacks or stroke.
