shortdesc: Echocardiography is a type of test that uses sound waves to create
  pictures of the heart. The picture and information it produces is more
  detailed than a standard x-ray image. An echocardiogram does not expose you to
  radiation.

  Echocardiography is a diagnostic procedure that uses sound waves (ultrasound)
  to create a detailed image of the heart and its surrounding structures. It is
  a non-invasive and painless test that is often used to assess the function and
  condition of the heart, and to diagnose a variety of heart conditions.


  There are several different types of echocardiography, including transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Transthoracic echocardiography is the most common type of echocardiography, and it involves placing a small, handheld device called a transducer on the patient's chest. The transducer sends sound waves through the chest wall and into the heart, and the echoes that are reflected back are used to create a detailed image of the heart on a monitor.


  Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a more specialized form of echocardiography that involves inserting a flexible tube with a transducer on the end into the patient's esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach). TEE provides a clearer and more detailed image of the heart than TTE, and it is often used to diagnose certain heart conditions that may be difficult to visualize using TTE alone.


  Contrast transesophageal echocardiography (cTEE) is a variation of TEE that involves injecting a special dye (contrast material) into the patient's bloodstream before the procedure. The contrast material helps to enhance the visibility of the heart and blood vessels, making it easier for the healthcare provider to identify certain structures and abnormalities.


  Overall, echocardiography (including cTEE) is a safe and effective way to assess the function and condition of the heart, and it can provide valuable information for diagnosis and management of a variety of heart conditions.
