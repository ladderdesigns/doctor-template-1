shortdesc: A cardiac event monitor is a device that you control to record the
  electrical activity of your heart (ECG). This device is about the size of a
  pager. It records your heart rate and rhythm. Cardiac event monitors are used
  when you need long-term monitoring of symptoms that occur less than daily.

  Holter monitoring is a procedure that is used to continuously record the
  electrical activity of the heart over a period of time. It is often used to
  diagnose and manage heart conditions such as arrhythmias (abnormal heart
  rhythms), and can help healthcare providers to identify patterns and triggers
  that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.


  During a Holter monitoring procedure, the patient wears a small, portable device called a Holter monitor for 24 to 48 hours (or longer, depending on the specific needs of the patient). The monitor is typically worn around the patient's waist or on a shoulder strap, and is connected to a series of electrodes that are placed on the patient's chest. The electrodes detect the electrical signals produced by the heart, and the monitor records these signals for later analysis.


  A loop recorder implantation is a more permanent form of heart monitoring, in which a small device is implanted under the skin in the patient's chest. The device, which is about the size of a matchstick, is connected to a thin wire that is placed under the skin and leads to the patient's heart. The device continuously records the electrical activity of the heart and can be activated by the patient (or their healthcare provider) when symptoms occur. The recorded data can then be downloaded and analyzed to help diagnose and manage heart conditions.
