shortdesc: EndoPAT testing is an FDA-cleared form of assessing endothelial
  function. The endothelium is the membrane that forms the inner lining of all
  blood vessels, and controls how your blood vessels dilate or constrict to
  affect blood pressure throughout your body. Endothelial cells perform a vital
  role in ensuring the homeostasis of the body (the equilibrium necessary for
  regular function), regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and auto-immune
  disease.

  EndoPAT (Endothelial Function Evaluation) is a non-invasive test that is used
  to evaluate the function of the endothelium, which is the inner lining of the
  blood vessels. The endothelium plays a critical role in maintaining normal
  blood flow and preventing the formation of blood clots, and abnormalities in
  endothelial function can increase the risk of serious health problems such as
  heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.


  During an EndoPAT evaluation, small sensors are placed on the patient's fingers, and a cuff is placed around the patient's arm. The sensors and cuff are connected to a device that measures changes in blood flow and blood pressure in response to different stimuli. The test involves inflating and deflating the cuff at various intervals, and measuring the response of the blood vessels in the fingers.


  The results of the EndoPAT evaluation can provide valuable information about the function of the endothelium, and can help Dr. Chandramouli identify potential problems or risk factors that may be contributing to poor vascular health. Based on the results of the test, Dr. Chandramouli may recommend lifestyle changes, medication adjustments, or other interventions to help improve endothelial function and reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
