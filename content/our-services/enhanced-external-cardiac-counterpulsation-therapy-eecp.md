  Enhanced external cardiac counterpulsation (EECP) is a non-invasive therapy
  that is used to improve blood flow to the heart and reduce symptoms of
  coronary artery disease. During EECP, a patient lies on a special treatment
  table, and three large cuffs are placed around their calves, thighs, and
  buttocks. These cuffs inflate and deflate in sync with the patient's
  heartbeat, providing a gentle massage-like sensation. The cuffs are connected
  to a machine that monitors the patient's heart rate and adjusts the timing of
  the cuff inflations accordingly.


  The goal of EECP is to increase blood flow to the heart during the resting phase of the cardiac cycle, when the heart is not contracting and pumping blood. This is achieved by using the cuffs to press on the large arteries in the legs, which helps to increase blood flow to the heart and reduce the workload of the heart muscle. EECP is typically administered in a series of sessions that are spread out over several weeks, and patients may experience some relief from their symptoms after just a few sessions. However, the full benefits of EECP may not be realized until several weeks or months after treatment has been completed.
