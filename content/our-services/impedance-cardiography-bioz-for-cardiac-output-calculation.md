shortdesc: Impedance cardiography (BioZ test) is a medical technology
  breakthrough that provides physicians safe, noninvasive access to information
  about your heart's ability to deliver blood to your body, how hard your heart
  is pumping, and how much blood is in your chest.

  Impedance cardiography (also known as BioZ) is a non-invasive method for
  measuring cardiac output, which is a measure of the amount of blood that is
  pumped by the heart in a given time period. Cardiac output is an important
  indicator of heart function, and it can be affected by various factors such as
  the heart rate, blood pressure, and the size and strength of the heart muscle.


  During impedance cardiography, small electrodes are placed on the patient's chest and connected to a device that measures the electrical resistance of the blood flow through the body. As the heart pumps blood, the electrical resistance of the blood changes in a predictable way. By measuring these changes, it is possible to calculate the cardiac output.


  Impedance cardiography is a quick and non-invasive way to measure cardiac output, and it can be performed in a variety of settings, including the hospital, a doctor's office, or even at home. The results of an impedance cardiography test can help healthcare providers to assess the patient's heart function and make decisions about their care, such as adjusting medications or recommending lifestyle changes.
