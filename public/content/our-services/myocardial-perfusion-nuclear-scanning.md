  Myocardial perfusion is an imaging test. It's also called a nuclear stress
  test. We perform it to see how well blood flows through the heart. It also
  shows how well the heart muscle is pumping. For example, after a heart attack,
  it may be done to find areas of damaged heart muscle. This test may be done
  during rest and while you exercise. We have a nationally accredited  nuclear
  medicine facility in office that we use to perform these tests.
