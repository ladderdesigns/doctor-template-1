  Myocardial perfusion is an imaging test. It's also called a nuclear stress
  test. It is performed to record how well blood flows through the heart. It
  also shows how well the heart muscle is pumping. For example, after a heart
  attack, it may be done to find areas of damaged heart muscle. This test may be
  done during rest and during exercise.
