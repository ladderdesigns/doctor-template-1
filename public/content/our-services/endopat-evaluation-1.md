shortdesc: EndoPAT testing is an FDA-cleared form of assessing endothelial
  function. The endothelium is the membrane that forms the inner lining of all
  blood vessels, and controls how your blood vessels dilate or constrict to
  affect blood pressure throughout your body. Endothelial cells perform a vital
  role in ensuring the homeostasis of the body (the equilibrium necessary for
  regular function), regulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and auto-immune
  disease.
