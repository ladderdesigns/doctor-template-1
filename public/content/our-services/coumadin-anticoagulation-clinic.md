shortdesc: Warfarin (Coumadin) is a medicine that makes your blood less likely
  to form clots. It is important that you take warfarin exactly as you have been
  told. Changing how you take your warfarin, taking other medicines, and eating
  certain foods all can change the way warfarin works in your body. If this
  happens, you may be more likely to form a clot or have bleeding problems.
