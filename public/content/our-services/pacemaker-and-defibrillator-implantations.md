shortdesc: A pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device. This device senses
  when your heart is beating irregularly or too slowly. It sends a signal to
  your heart that makes your heart beat at the correct pace. An implantable
  cardiac defibrillator is a device that monitors your heart rate and delivers a
  strong electrical shock to restore the heartbeat to normal in the event of
  tachycardia.
