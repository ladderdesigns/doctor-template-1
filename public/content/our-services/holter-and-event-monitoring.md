shortdesc: A cardiac event monitor is a device that you control to record the
  electrical activity of your heart (ECG). This device is about the size of a
  pager. It records your heart rate and rhythm. Cardiac event monitors are used
  when you need long-term monitoring of symptoms that occur less than daily.
