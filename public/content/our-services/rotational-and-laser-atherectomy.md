shortdesc: Coronary rotational atherectomy is a procedure that is similar to
  angioplasty, where a catheter with a balloon at its end is inserted and
  inflated to open a blocked artery. Sometimes, however, the blockage in the
  artery has calcified, or hardened. In this case, the angioplasty is unable to
  work against the plaque. During rotational atherectomy the plaque is ground
  into minuscule particles, which is then cleaned from the bloodstream.
